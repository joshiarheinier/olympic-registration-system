# University Olympic Registration System
## How to Setup on localhost
The platform uses CodeIgniter as the framework, so be sure to have Apache server running. I recommend XAMPP as it works well on my local.
1. Create a database on MySQL named `olympic_registration_schema` and import `olympic_registration_schema.sql` that can be found in `/db/schema`.
2. Open the app from the web browser.
To easily check if the web app is already connected to the database, you can open the registration page from menu `Daftar` and check if the faculty field is filled with lists of faculty name.
